# Example indices alignment
# 012345
# ABCACA

# 01234
# BAACB

# The alignment
# ABCA_CA
# _B_AACB
# is then represented by
# [1, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 3, 4]
# because the '1st' letter (0-indexed) of the first string matches with the
# 0th of the second string, the 3rd of the first matches with the 1st of the
# second, ..., and then the 5th of the first MIS-matches with the 4th of the
# second - i.e both matches and mismatches are written down but indels are not


# Self = 0, Left = 1, Diag = 2, Up = 3
# Relying on the order of code is poor form - not easily readable



# When starting after dinner:
   1. Check that the changed swapped normal code is right - i.e that we get the
    correct score and the correct starting place
   2. Fully test the recursive code - likely to be a lot of bugs
